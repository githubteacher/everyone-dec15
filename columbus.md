# Columbus, OH

- Capital of Ohio
- Home of the Buckeyes, Blue Jackets, Crew, and Clippers
- Fun afternoon: buy a book at The Book Loft in German Village, grab some macaroons and a coffee at Pistachia Vera, and enjoy both at Schiller Park. (Visit in the summer, not the fall unless you like to be stuck in college football traffic.)
- A lot of people like to shop at Easton Towne Center, but it is too crowded for my liking.
