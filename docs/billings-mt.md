# Billings

- The best thing about Billings is the view from the top of the Rimrocks, a sandstone bluff that runs along the north side of the Yellowstone valley.

- You will drive up Zimmerman trail to the top of the Rims, and find a spot in one of the parks to pull over.
- Sunsets are beautiful.
- The current temp is 54 F
- I will not be able to visit old stompig grounds as they are now covered in houses!
- Adding a few more lines while working in desktop.
